Baby's first noteskin. For Stepmania 5.1+

Diving right in to the deep end with the new noteskin system. I'm attempting to strike a balance between the advantages of quant-colored noteskins and lane-colored noteskins by incorporating both colors on one note using outlines. This could make a comfortable universal noteskin for many people to use, but it's also going to be a learning experience. 

In the future, I hope to use this as a base for a more sophisticated noteskin with better visuals and more features, and maybe a 3D version as well (if bodygroups become a thing).

## Functionality Targets

* Game Mode Support
  * Universal – all buttons/modes supported. May also be rolling release, updated to fit new modes and certain custom modes in SM6.
* Noteskin Options
  * Variants – different color and note schemes as you please
      * Default – quant color inside, lane color outside.
      * Inverted – lane color inside, quant color outside.
      * PureNote – only quant color, no outline.
      * Flat – only lane color, no outline.
      * "Edit" versions of each of these, with quantized mines and clearly distinguished fakes.
  * New Quants – toggle new experimental quantizations for quintuplets (up to 20ths), septuplets (up to 28ths), and nonuplets (up to 36ths.)
  * Receptor Warnings – wanna steal these from Kyzentun 'cause they're cool. I want mine to darken the receptors though, instead of turning any specific color (ideally, warning color would be customizable, but that would require non-monochrome colorizable graphics, unlike the current masks).
* Miscellaneous
  * No "Solo Syndrome" where hold bodies don't attach properly to diags (may need more functionality for this, kludging it as a hold head right now)
  * I am attempting to support modes and note types that don't exist yet but have been considered, such as Mine-Holds (an iDANCE idea lying inert in the codebase), Checkpoint Holds (as a separate note type) and Traces/Follows (for Sound Voltex, ReRave/Osu, and more.)
